Drift ships with an experimental analyzer plugin that provides real-time feedback on errors,
hints, folding and outline.

## Features

At the moment, the IDE supports 

- auto-complete to suggest matching keywords as you type
- warnings and errors for your queries
- navigation (Ctrl click on a reference to see where a column or table is declared)
- an outline view highlighting tables and queries
- folding inside `CREATE TABLE` statements and import-blocks

We would very much like to support syntax highlighting, but sadly VS Code doesn't support
that. Please upvote [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/585) to help
us here.

## Setup
To use the plugin, you need a supported editor (see below).

First, tell the Dart analysis server to run the drift plugin. Create a file called
`analysis_options.yaml` in your project root, next to your pubspec. It should contain
this section:
```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - drift
```

Then, follow the steps for the IDE you want to use.

### Using with VS Code

To use the drift analyzer plugin in VS Code, use

1. Tell Dart Code to analyze drift files. Add this to your `settings.json`:
```json
"dart.additionalAnalyzerFileExtensions": ["drift"]
```
2. close and re-open your IDE so that the analysis server is restarted. The analysis server will
   then load the drift plugin and start providing analysis results for `.drift` files. Loading the plugin
   can take some time (around a minute for the first time).

### Other IDEs

Unfortunately, we can't support IntelliJ and Android Studio yet. Please vote on
[this issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-41424) to help us here!

As a workaround, you can configure IntelliJ to recognize drift files as sql. Drift-only
features like imports and Dart templates will report errors, but the rest of the
syntax works well. See [this comment](https://github.com/simolus3/moor/issues/150#issuecomment-538582696)
on how to set this up.

If you're looking for support for an other IDE that uses the Dart analysis server,
please create an issue. We can probably make that happen.
