_Note_: Since `moor_flutter` uses the sqlite version shipped on the device, these extensions might not
be available on all devices. When using these extensions, using a `NativeDatabase` is strongly recommended.
This enables the extensions listed here on all Android and iOS devices.

## json1

To enable the json1 extension in drift files and compiled queries, modify your
[build options]({{ "../Advanced Features/builder_options.md" | pageUrl }}) to include 
`json1` in the `sqlite_module` section.

The sqlite extension doesn't require any special tables and works on all text columns. In drift
files and compiled queries, all `json` functions are available after enabling the extension.

Since the json extension is optional, enabling it in Dart requires a special import,
`package:drift/extensions/json1.dart`. An example that uses json functions in Dart is shown below:
```dart
import 'package:drift/drift.dart';
import 'package:drift/extensions/json1.dart';

class Contacts extends Table {
    IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
    TextColumn get data => text()();
}

@DriftDatabase(tables: [Contacts])
class Database extends _$Database {
  // constructor and schemaVersion omitted for brevity

  Future<List<Contacts>> findContactsWithNumber(String number) {
    return (select(contacts)
      ..where((row) {
        // assume the phone number is stored in a json key in the `data` column
        final phoneNumber = row.data.jsonExtract<String, StringType>('phone_number');
        return phoneNumber.equals(number);
      })
    ).get();
  } 
}
```

You can learn more about the json1 extension on [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html).

## fts5

The fts5 extension provides full-text search capabilities in sqlite tables.
To enable the fts5 extension in drift files and compiled queries, modify the 
[build options]({{ "../Advanced Features/builder_options.md" | pageUrl }}) to include 
`fts5` in the `sqlite_module` section.

Just like you'd expect when using sqlite, you can create a fts5 table in a drift file
by using a `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` statement.
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE email USING fts5(sender, title, body);
```

Queries on fts5 tables work like expected:
```sql
emailsWithFts5: SELECT * FROM email WHERE email MATCH 'fts5' ORDER BY rank;
```

The `bm25`, `highlight` and `snippet` functions from fts5 can also be used in custom queries.

It's not possible to declare fts5 tables, or queries on fts5 tables, in Dart.
