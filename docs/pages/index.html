Drift is an easy to use, reactive persistence library for Flutter apps. Define tables in Dart or
SQL and enjoy a fluent query API, auto-updating streams and more!

With drift, you can write your database tables in pure Dart without having to miss out on
advanced sqlite features. Drift will take care of creating the tables and generate code
that allows you run fluent queries on your data.

{% block "blocks/markdown.html" %}
Drift contains a powerful sql parser and analyzer, allowing it to create typesafe APIs for all your sql queries. All sql queries are
validated and analyzed during build-time, so drift can provide hints about potential errors quickly and generate efficient mapping
code.

Drift provides auto-updating streams for all your queries, makes dealing with transactions and migrations easy
and lets your write modular database code with DAOs. We even have a [sql IDE]({{ 'docs/Using SQL/sql_ide.md' | pageUrl }}) builtin to the project
When using drift, working with databases in Dart is fun!

## Key features

Here are some of the many ways drift helps you write awesome database code:

 * __Auto-updating streams__: With drift, any query - no matter how complex - can be turned into a stream that emits new data as the underlying data changes.
 * __Polyglot__: Drift lets you write queries in a fluent Dart api or directly in SQL - you can even embed Dart expressions in SQL.
 * __Boilerplate-free__: Stop writing mapping code yourself - drift can take of that. Drift generates Dart code around your data so you can focus
	on building great apps.
 * __Flexible__: Want to write queries in SQL? Drift verifies them at compile time and generates Dart apis for them. Prefer to write them in Dart?
	Drift will generate efficient SQL for Dart queries too.
 * __Easy to learn__: Instead of having to learn yet another ORM, drift lets you write queries in SQL and generates typesafe wrappers. Queries and tables
	can also be written in Dart that looks similar to SQL without loosing type-safety.
 * __Fast _and_ powerful__: With the new `ffi` backend, drift can outperform key-value stores without putting any compromises on the integrity
	and flexibility that relational databases provide. Drift is the only major persistence library with builtin support for multiple isolates.
 * __Well tested and production ready__: Each component of drift is verified by a wide range of unit and integration tests. Drift powers many Flutter apps
	in production.
 * __Cross-Platform__: Drift works on iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Windows and on the web. It doesn't even require Flutter. See [supported platforms]({{ "docs/platforms.md" | pageUrl }}).
